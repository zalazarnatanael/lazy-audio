## About
[![Product screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://lazy-audio.vercel.app/)


Lazy Audio is a WebApp that transcribes your audios or conversations into text format. It is very useful when you are busy and cannot listen to an audio. Lazy Audio offers you the possibility to transcribe it in just a few clicks.

This magic happens thanks to Assembly AI, which provides very accurate transcriptions. Additionally, it supports multiple languages; in our case, we only identify Spanish and English.
